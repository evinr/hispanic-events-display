2. Display a results view of events for 2015. This view should contain each event date (day, month), event time, and store location. It should also have a ‘see more details’ or ‘get more info’ link that will trigger an overlay (lightbox) that contains complete information for each event. Please include all the following fields:
a. Event date(day, month)
b. Event time
c. Event Store location and Store Floor
d. Event City
e. Event Description
f. RSVP url if applicable.
3. Lightbox view should be able to close on click of ‘X’ or close link.
4. Email back a zip file containing your html, css, and javascript (you may use JQuery as well if needed).

###Extra Credit:
1. Make it responsive!
2. Allow users to navigate to the next event without leaving the lightbox view.

###Modifications:
1. Styled.
2. Added the state to the city in the lightbox.
3. Removed the RSVP link from the description (but should filter on if it has the field present) in the lightbox.
